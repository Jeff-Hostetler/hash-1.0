# HELP!

A friend of yours is getting married, but the site they used to track their wedding plans went out of business.

The failed startup was kind enough to send them a data dump, but it's in a crazy nested hash.

They've asked you to help them decipher the data, and answer some questions.

## Instructions

* Go through each file in order
* Read the comments in the file
* Write the code using `puts` statements to generate the expected result
* Run the files with `ruby 00_example.rb` to check your work
